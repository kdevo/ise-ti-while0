## Exercise 2: While0 to URM

### Proposal: URM-sym language extension

Introduce a symbol table phase for URM to make "programming" a little less messy:
1. Map every label `<LBL>` to the matching line number (output: `{<LBL1>: <NO1>, <LBL2>: <NO2>}, ...}`).
    - A label is defined as `LBL: \<[A-Z0-9_]+\>;`
    - Advantage: "Normal" line *numbers* can still be used with the expression defined above.
2. Replace evert `<LBL>` with the actual line number using the output of 1.

### Transformation

For the given `while V1 != V2 do begin α end` a transformation to URM could look as follows:

```
in(V1, V2);
loc(T1, T2);
<COP1>: COPY(V1, T1);
<COP2>: COPY(V2, T2);
<T1>: T1--;
<T2>: T2--;
<TEST_T1>: if T1 == 0 goto <TEST_T2>;
<ELSE>: if T2 == 0 goto <WHILEBODY>;
<GO_BACK>: goto <T1>;
<TEST_T2>: if T2 == 0 goto <ABORT>;
<WHILEBODY>: α
<LOOP>: goto <COP1>;
<ABORT>: ...
```

- Temp variables `T1, T2` are needed because `α` could have dependent calculations on `V1` or `V2`. That is why we cannot work on them directly.
- For the same reason described above, `V1` and `V2` are consequently copied in **each** iteration/loop.
